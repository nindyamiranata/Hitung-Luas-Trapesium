# Trapezoid Area Calculator
Hi guys! This is a simple Python project that calculates the 'area of a trapezoid' using input values provided by the user.
It's part of my early learning journey in programming. I'm still exploring and growing, and this small project means a lot to me 💻✨

---

The program:
- Welcomes the user with a message
- Asks for the purpose of the visit (just for fun 💬)
- Accepts three inputs: base A, base B, and height
- Calculates the area using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base A} + \text{Base B}) \times \text{Height}
  \]
- Displays the result in a friendly way

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python (basic input/output, variables, and arithmetic operations)

## 💌 Message from Me

I believe every big dream starts from small steps.  
This is one of mine — and I'm proud to share it!🌱

## 📥 How to Run It
Just run the `.py` file in your Python environment (IDLE, Replit, VSCode, etc.)

---

## ✨ Future Plans
- Add input validation for better experience
- Create a version with a graphical interface (GUI)
- Build more shape calculators and bundle them together
